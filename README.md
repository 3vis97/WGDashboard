## 📣 What's New: v4.0

- 🎉  **New Features**
  - **Updated dashboard design**: Re-designed some of the section with more modern style and layout, the UI is faster and more responsive, it also uses less memory. But overall is still the same dashboard you're familiarized.
  - **Docker Solution**: We now have 2 docker solutions! Thanks to @DaanSelen & @shuricksumy for providing them. For more information, please see the [Docker](#-docker-solutions) section below.
  - **Peer Job Scheduler**: Now you can schedule jobs for each peer to either **restrict** or **delete** the peer if the peer's total / upload / download data usage exceeded a limit, or you can set a specific datetime to restrict or delete the peer.
  - **Share Peer's QR Code with Public Link**: You can share a peer's QR code and `.conf` file without the need to loging in.
  - **WGDashboard's REST API**: You can now request all the api endpoint used in the dashboard. For more details please review the [API Documentation](./docs/api-documents.md).
  - **Logging**: Dashboard will now log all activity on the dashboard and API requests.
  - **Time-Based One-Time Password (TOTP)**: You can enable this function to add one more layer of security, and generate the TOTP with your choice of authenticator.
  - **Designs**
    - **Real-time Graphs**: You can view real-time data changes with graphs in each configuration.
    - **Night mode**: You know what that means, it avoids bugs ;)
  - **Enforce Python Virtual Environment**: I noticed newer Python version (3.12) does not allow to install packages globally, and plus I think is a good idea to use venv.
 
- **🧐  Other Changes**
  - **Deprecated jQuery from the project, and migrated and rewrote the whole front-end with Vue.js. This allows the dashboard is future proofed, and potential cross server access with a desktop app.**
  - Rewrote the backend into a REST API structure
  - Improved SQL query efficient
  - Removed all templates, except for `index.html` where it will load the Vue.js app.

- **🥘  New Experimental Features**
  - **Cross-Server Access**: Now you can access other servers that installed `v4` of WGDashboard through API key.
  - **Desktop App**: Thanks to **Cross-Server Access**, you can now download an ElectronJS based desktop app of WGDashboard, and use that to access WGDashboard on different servers.

## 🛠 Install
1. Download WGDashboard

   ```shell
   git clone -b v4.0 https://github.com/donaldzou/WGDashboard.git wgdashboard
   
2. Open the WGDashboard folder

   ```shell
   cd wgdashboard/src
   ```
   
3. Install WGDashboard

   ```shell
   sudo chmod u+x wgd.sh
   sudo ./wgd.sh install
   ```

4. Give read and execute permission to root of the WireGuard configuration folder, you can change the path if your configuration files are not stored in `/etc/wireguard`

   ```shell
   sudo chmod -R 755 /etc/wireguard
   ```

5. Run WGDashboard

   ```shell
   sudo ./wgd.sh start
   ```
   
   **Note**:

   > For [`pivpn`](https://github.com/pivpn/pivpn) user, please use `sudo ./wgd.sh start` to run if your current account does not have the permission to run `wg show` and `wg-quick`.

6. Access dashboard

   Access your server with port `10086` (e.g. http://your_server_ip:10086), using username `admin` and password `admin`. See below how to change port and ip that the dashboard is running with.

## 🪜 Usage

#### Start/Stop/Restart WGDashboard


```shell
cd wgdashboard/src
-----------------------------
./wgd.sh start    # Start the dashboard in background
-----------------------------
./wgd.sh debug    # Start the dashboard in foreground (debug mode)
-----------------------------
./wgd.sh stop     # Stop the dashboard
-----------------------------
./wgd.sh restart  # Restart the dasboard
```

#### Autostart WGDashboard on boot (>= v2.2)

In the `src` folder, it contained a file called `wg-dashboard.service`, we can use this file to let our system to autostart the dashboard after reboot. The following guide has tested on **Ubuntu**, most **Debian** based OS might be the same, but some might not. Please don't hesitate to provide your system if you have tested the autostart on another system.

1. Changing the directory to the dashboard's directory

   ```shell
   cd wgdashboard/src
   ```

2. Get the full path of the dashboard's directory

   ```shell
   pwd
   #Output: /root/wgdashboard/src
   ```

   For this example, the output is `/root/wireguard-dashboard/src`, your path might be different since it depends on where you downloaded the dashboard in the first place. **Copy the the output to somewhere, we will need this in the next step.**

3. Edit the service file, the service file is located in `wireguard-dashboard/src`, you can use other editor you like, here will be using `nano`

   ```shell
   nano wg-dashboard.service
   ```

   You will see something like this:

   ```ini
   [Unit]
   After=syslog.target network-online.target
   Wants=wg-quick.target
   ConditionPathIsDirectory=/etc/wireguard
   
   [Service]
   Type=forking
   PIDFile=<absolute_path_of_wgdashboard_src>/gunicorn.pid
   WorkingDirectory=<absolute_path_of_wgdashboard_src>
   ExecStart=<absolute_path_of_wgdashboard_src>/wgd.sh start
   ExecStop=<absolute_path_of_wgdashboard_src>/wgd.sh stop
   ExecReload=<absolute_path_of_wgdashboard_src>/wgd.sh restart
   TimeoutSec=120
   PrivateTmp=yes
   Restart=always
   
   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

   Now, we need to replace all `<absolute_path_of_wgdashboard_src>` to the one you just copied from step 2. After doing this, the file will become something like this, your file might be different:

   **Be aware that after the value of `WorkingDirectory`, it does not have  a `/` (slash).** And then save the file after you edited it

4. Copy the service file to systemd folder

   ```bash
   $ sudo cp wg-dashboard.service /etc/systemd/system/wg-dashboard.service
   ```

   To make sure you copy the file successfully, you can use this command `cat /etc/systemd/system/wg-dashboard.service` to see if it will output the file you just edited.

5. Enable the service

   ```bash
   $ sudo chmod 664 /etc/systemd/system/wg-dashboard.service
   $ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   $ sudo systemctl enable wg-dashboard.service
   $ sudo systemctl start wg-dashboard.service  # <-- To start the service
   ```

6. Check if the service run correctly

   ```bash
   $ sudo systemctl status wg-dashboard.service
   ```
   And you should see something like this

   ```shell
    ● wg-dashboard.service
    Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/wg-dashboard.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
    Active: active (running) since Wed 2024-08-14 22:21:47 EDT; 55s ago

    Aug 14 22:21:47 wg systemd[1]: Started wg-dashboard.service.
   ```

   If you see `Active:` followed by `active (running) since...` then it means it run correctly. 

7. Stop/Start/Restart the service

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop wg-dashboard.service      # <-- To stop the service
   sudo systemctl start wg-dashboard.service     # <-- To start the service
   sudo systemctl restart wg-dashboard.service   # <-- To restart the service
   ```

8. **And now you can reboot your system, and use the command at step 6 to see if it will auto start after the reboot, or just simply access the dashboard through your browser. If you have any questions or problem, please report it in the issue page.**

## ✂️ Dashboard Configuration

#### Dashboard Configuration file

Since version 2.0, WGDashboard will be using a configuration file called `wg-dashboard.ini`, (It will generate automatically after first time running the dashboard). More options will include in future versions, and for now it included the following configurations:

#### Generating QR code and peer configuration file (.conf)

Starting version 2.2, dashboard can now generate QR code and configuration file for each peer. Here is a template of what each QR code encoded with and the same content will be inside the file:

```ini
[Interface]
PrivateKey = QWERTYUIOPO234567890YUSDAKFH10E1B12JE129U21=
Address = 0.0.0.0/32
DNS = 1.1.1.1

[Peer]
PublicKey = QWERTYUIOPO234567890YUSDAKFH10E1B12JE129U21=
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
Endpoint = 0.0.0.0:51820
```

## ❓ How to update the dashboard?

#### **Please note for users who are using `v3 - v3.0.6` want to update to `v4.0`**
- Although theoretically updating through `wgd.sh` should work, but I still suggest you to update the dashboard manually.

#### **Please note for users who are using `v2.3.1` or below**

- For user who is using `v2.3.1` or below, please notice that all data that stored in the current database will **not** transfer to the new database. This is hard decision to move from TinyDB to SQLite. But SQLite does provide a thread-safe access and TinyDB doesn't. I couldn't find a safe way to transfer the data, so you need to do them manually... Sorry about that :pensive:。 But I guess this would be a great start for future development :sunglasses:.


1. Change your directory to `wgdashboard` 
   
    ```shell
    cd wgdashboard/src
    ```
    
2. Update the dashboard
    ```shell
    git pull https://github.com/donaldzou/WGDashboard.git v4.0 --force
    ```

3. Install

   ```shell
   sudo ./wgd.sh install
   ```

Starting with `v3.0`, you can simply do `sudo ./wgd.sh update` !! (I hope)

## 🐬 Docker Solutions

## 🥘 Experimental Functions

### Cross-Server Access

Starting with `v4.0`, you can access WGDashboards on other server through one WGDashboard with API Keys

![Cross Server Example](https://donaldzou.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/wgdashboard-images/cross-server.gif)

### Desktop App

Since the major changes for `v4.0` is to move the whole front-end code to Vue.js. And with this change, we can take the
advantage of combining ElectronJS and Vue.js to create a Desktop version of WGDashboard. Currently, we provide an Universal macOS app and a Windows app.

To download the app, please visit the [latest release](https://github.com/donaldzou/WGDashboard/releases).
